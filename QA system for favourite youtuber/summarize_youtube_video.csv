1 hour call with Mark Zuckerberg.  We attempted to create the high school version of Facebook.,"How did you call Mark Zuckerberg and explain that story? 2005, he was some junior at Harvard. Facebook was in 10 colleges or 20 colleges. And we were like, let's start a high school version of Facebook called the business, the high list.com. And it was actually cool. We built the whole thing. We launched it. Actually, we started to see all the same trends of virality. You get to the end of the summer and he pings us and goes, Mark Zuckerberg wants to buy HS Facebook. They're launching in high schools. And he picks up the phone. Hello. And I'm like, hey, Mark. I just like sat silent for the next 45 minutes while he kind of outlined their whole strategy and most of what they did for the next 10 years.","In 2005, the speaker created a high school version of Facebook called the highlist.com. Mark Zuckerberg wanted to buy it and shared his strategy for the next 10 years."
1 trait of being a great entrepreneur： worrying about what matters when it matters.,"This is one of the hallmarks of being a great entrepreneur is worrying about what matters when it matters. Example, we were starting Growth Assistant. Well, we need to figure out if it's legal to do what we're doing. And I'm like, well, no, we're not going to spend any money on that. Let's go see if there's a business here. And then if there is in a year, we'll actually have the resources to figure out if it's legal and how to make it legal, which is exactly what we ended up doing. And I think people who join a five person company, they generally are not going to walk in and go, I need a laptop and I need a T-shirt and I need lots of proper health. I don't know, man. They get it. And you just have to be honest.","Being a great entrepreneur means prioritizing what matters. For example, when starting Growth Assistant, they focused on building the business first before worrying about legalities. Joining a small company requires understanding and honesty."
3 Lessons From My Immigrant Entrepreneur Dad,"Here are three lessons I learned from my immigrant entrepreneur dad. Lesson one, the customer always comes first. One time when I was a kid, I answered the phones at his office and I said, oh, he's busy right now. And he took me in the room and said, you never tell a customer I'm busy. Tell them I'm on the other line and call them back as soon as possible. Lesson number two was hard work can always win and set you apart. I watched my dad travel from meeting to meeting to bring in new business and it left a huge imprint on what it takes to make it successful. And lesson number three is know your numbers. Accounting is the lifeblood of any business. It's the nuts and bolts. And if you don't know your numbers, you don't know your business.","Lessons from an immigrant entrepreneur: prioritize customers, work hard to stand out, and understand the importance of accounting."
4 ways to manage your energy and succeed day in and day out #skills #entrepreneurship #business,"You don't actually have a discipline problem. What you have is an energy problem. Here are four ways to think about managing your energy a little bit better. Number one, work like a lion, not a cow. Most of us have been taught, let's wake up, let's go nine to five, sit at a desk, do the same thing over and over. People who focus on their energy think about when they get the most done and they work during those times, just like a lion waits to go get its prey. Find your zone of genius. There's actually four zones. The zone of incompetence. That's stuff you don't know how to do. The zone of competence, stuff you know how to do, like maybe drive a car. Zone of excellence. For me, that might be spreadsheets. But zone of genius is something that not only am I good at, like the zone of excellence, but also gives me energy. Think yes and not either or. And last but not least, make sure that you're enjoying the people you work around. When you work with people you love, it's just fun every day and you don't have to worry about.","Managing energy is key to productivity. Focus on working during your most productive times, find your zone of genius, think yes and not either or, and enjoy working with people you love."
5 things in your To-Do List you don't need？ Do this instead.,"actionable, personal challenge to the audience. Just remove the bottom five items on your to-do list. Whatever's on your to-do list right now, pull it out and just like, I'm not going to do these this week or next week. I'm not going to guilt myself. I'm going to focus on these top three or five that I actually have to focus on and I'm going to do a better job of those. It's funny how when you remove the kind of BS seven out of 10 tasks, you get a whole lot better at the top ones. Totally.","The speaker suggests removing unimportant tasks from the to-do list to focus on the top priorities, leading to better performance."
7 Books that changed my life #goodreads #books #knowledge,"Entrepreneurs, here's seven books that changed my life. Number one, two, and three is my favorite genre of book, Entrepreneur Bios. Losing My Virginity by Richard Branson, where he just talks about how crazy he was to start an airline and his record label. Shoe Dog, number two, the story of Nike. Nike seems like a big company today, but back then he was flying back and forth to Japan and trying to sell knockoff shoes. And number three is Made in America by Sam Walton, the story of Walmart. Number four and number five are books that taught me some new skills. Influenced by Robert Cialdini, he talks about some of the core principles that influence people via marketing and sales. It's a must read for anybody who's gonna be an entrepreneur. Number five is The Hard Thing About Hard Things. Here's a book where it really describes how tough it is to be a startup CEO and what you're gonna encounter. Number six, The Great CEO Within. It is by far the best guide of day-to-day running a company I have ever read. It has specific tips and is written by someone who really knows the job inside and out. Number seven, my all-time most life-changing favorite book is 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership.","The transcript discusses seven books that have had a significant impact on the speaker's life as an entrepreneur, including biographies, skill-building books, and guides for running a company."
"B2B is Easier Than B2C, Here's Why.","And one of the beauties of B2B anything, like the original business of Ampush, we got on a whiteboard. I drew a grid for 20 slides. We mocked up a story about how Facebook was going to take over the world and how we were the best in the world at Facebook. And we went and we just said, we went to LinkedIn and said, hey, will you meet with us? Will you meet with us? Hey, Daily Deals, hey, gaming companies. Like we knew who was spending on it. And after 10 phone calls, two said yes. And guess what? We had a business, right? And so that's the one thing about B2B that I think is beautiful is you can just get on the phone and start pitching people. You see their reactions, you get their feedback. It's in some ways it's way easier than B2C.","Ampush started their B2B business by pitching to companies like LinkedIn and Daily Deals, and after 10 phone calls, they had a successful business."
Being a Better Version Of Yourself by Overcoming Fear and Embracing Growth,"What's the biggest difference between Jesse from 2016 and Jesse today? The ability to know when I'm feeling threat or when I'm constricted or I'm not open and to be able to actually stop myself in the moment to make that switch. I think I'm better at communicating than I was then. I think I spent most of my time operating out of fear in 2016 and prior and now I spend significantly less time operating out of fear. I still spend a lot of time operating out of fear, but a lot more time in my genius and things that I think learning mode and being open, wanting to help people, just things that are not about fear.","Jesse has improved in recognizing and managing his emotions, communicating better, and spending less time operating out of fear."
Best career path for 2023 #growth #business #marketing #skilldevelopment,"20 years ago, everyone knew software engineering was important. They couldn't find a software engineer and nobody quite understood how it worked. Billion dollar companies like Wipro, even Accenture to some degree, that's all they do, essentially. They find offshore engineers. We think the same thing is going to happen in growth marketing, which is part of the thesis there. You know, what I tell people is it's a new discipline. You know, there's like investment banking and trading, and they're very quantitative, analytical people, and that's what they do. There's like traditional marketers who are creative. There's like Internet people who are hustly. And you kind of need all those things in one skill set.","The importance of software engineering 20 years ago is compared to the emerging field of growth marketing, which requires a combination of quantitative analysis, creativity, and hustle."
Building A Community and Maximizing Your Impact on Twitter,"I think a couple of learnings on Twitter, I'd say the first one is I would not start by writing threads. That's like one of the first things I tell people. It's a little bit of the tree falling in the forest thing. Like if you have 200 followers or even 1,000 followers and you start writing threads, there's no one there to hear, you know, the tree fall sort of thing. And so I advise people really build up yourself to probably 2,000 to 3,000 by engaging with the community. Like really get to be part of that community so that there's a bunch of people who are following you because they've seen you say smart things and like what you're talking about. Then I would try a couple single tweet type things. And then I would probably start writing threads. Obviously there's some art to writing something that's kind of gets people emotional and gets the curiosity. And that's a real art.","Starting on Twitter, it is advised to engage with the community and build up a following before writing threads. Crafting emotional and intriguing content is key."
Building Your Business By Solving a Common Problem,"The term bloating is searched more often than the term erectile dysfunction. And one doctor came to us and she said, you know, one third of women suffer from bloating. It's a huge issue. Nobody's addressed it. It's a really uncomfortable feeling. There's a variety of different reasons that it could be caused by. And so we launched this brand Unbloat.me. It's a single supplement, you know, ends bloating. We launched it in January and we're close to a thousand subs already. And we're at unit economic profitability.","Unbloat.me, a supplement that addresses bloating, has gained popularity with close to a thousand subscribers and is already profitable."
Business ideas in college #entrepreneurship #money #ecommerce #wealth,"My dumbest idea I've ever had was self-erasing chalkboards. We used to sit in college with my co-founders and I'd be like, dude, this professor's spending like 10 minutes of this class and we're paying an inordinate amount of money for erasing the freaking chalkboard. And then, you know, those chalkboards that go by each other. I was like, there should be a button that pushes an eraser so that when he does this, it just in one fell swoop swipes it. The only lesson I would tell anyone from that, look for problem. Like I was just sitting there in class going like, there's a problem. This seems really dumb. That to me is a great place to start any kind of business ideation process.","The speaker's dumbest idea was self-erasing chalkboards, which led to the realization that identifying problems is a good starting point for business ideas."

Changing Landscapes and Empowering Your Team With AI,"Are you planning for AI this year within your businesses? A hundred percent. It's showing up everywhere for us. I had a conversation with Adrian as we were thinking about value add initiatives for customers. And I said, what if we trained all the Philippines talent on the top three to five AI tools? Imagine someone shows up and they go, Oh yeah, I know how to use Jasper. I know how to use chat GPT three. Just tell me what you need. And so, boom, that's an entire value prop. And to me, if we launch more brands, we're absolutely going to be leveraging parts of this.","AI is being incorporated into businesses, with plans to train talent on top AI tools to provide value to customers and potentially launch more brands."
Compound interest calculator. #investing #money #wealth #entrepreneur,"I just think people still don't understand how powerful compounding is. Go to Compound Interest Calculator on Google, but let's say you're 35 or 30, put a million bucks in, you add $100,000 to it every year, and you compound it at 8%. When you're 65, how much money do you think you'll have? Three, four million? 23 million. Oh, shit. Exactly.","The speaker emphasizes the power of compounding by using a compound interest calculator example, showing that investing a million dollars with yearly additions can result in 23 million dollars by age 65."
Debunking Common Misconceptions and The Realities of Being a Startup Founder,What are the biggest myths or misconceptions that people have about startup founders? I feel like my biggest misconception before I was an entrepreneur and then the one I hear the most often is that they know what they're doing. Like that they actually have some skill or some special secret sauce versus just like no idea and every day you're like figuring it out as you go and you're curious and you ask questions.,"The biggest misconception about startup founders is that they know what they're doing. In reality, they are constantly figuring things out and asking questions."
Do We Really Need Meetings？,"What I'm saying to myself is like, why do you need a meeting for that? Why do you need the time spent to actually talk about it? Yeah, I don't think you need it. I think I like it. And I think having the Bali and then having the accountability and everybody seeing what's going on and the connectivity is valuable. I've learned as I've gotten older, you know, I don't argue for what's right and wrong. It's a waste of time. I wish I could look at a dashboard, but like I got kids. I'm giving them breakfast and taking them to school. So for me, no matter what time has to be blocked on my calendar to do something. So if I think you're going to get value out of it, also by hearing my feedback by other people, then I think we should do a meeting. Now, if meetings become stupid, like I'm also the first person to look at a meeting the next day and go, guys, I don't think we need this anymore.",The speaker questions the necessity of meetings and values transparency and accountability. They prioritize time management and only advocate for meetings that provide value.
Don't Let Perfectionism Hold You Back. Start Testing Your Ideas Now.,"I often just find entrepreneurs getting stuck with either overbaking their idea before they actually go into the world or like severely underbaking it and not being realistic with themselves. And I'll just oftentimes find myself asking like, well, have you, have you sold this to any customers? Like, no, I talked to 10 and I validated, I'm like, but have you pitched it to them? Have you asked them for money? No, I haven't. And so even for those listening who aren't maybe entrepreneurs, you said it and I want to just say it again. What is the cheapest, fastest way you can get anything going and you can start to try anything? And I think that question isn't just a, for a founder, but it's, it's for especially employees at startups. When someone talks about an idea, your immediate things, you go cheapest, fastest, cheapest, fastest, and try to go figure out whether or not that there's a there.","The transcript emphasizes the importance of entrepreneurs validating their ideas by selling and pitching to customers, and encourages individuals to adopt a mindset of finding the cheapest and fastest way to test ideas."
Embracing Change and Having a Fresh Start For New Challenges,"You're going from being a one-person company to a five-person company to a 20-person company. And a 20 and a five are completely different companies. The way they operate is different. The way communication flows is different. The way sales works is different. Just everything is different. When you promote someone, one of the classic things you coach them on, or I do at least, is, hey, this is a different job. You've been promoted. Go home for the weekend. Update your LinkedIn. When you come in, pretend as if you never worked here before. Because the biggest challenge people have when they're transitioning roles, they keep doing their old job or they keep thinking in their old ways, and you really want them to think in the new way as if they came in from another organization. And then the number one person who has to do that is the CEO, because the job is just so different.","Transitioning from a small to a larger company requires a shift in mindset and approach. This is especially true for the CEO, as the role is drastically different."
Entrepreneurship Cheat Code - The Entrepreneur Mindset Shift #business #entrepreneurship #skills,"After running a company of you know, close to 200 people for eight, nine years, I think I got back into kind of entrepreneurship gear took me a few months, because I was used to like having, you know, CEO and an office manager and assistant and people to do work. And it took me a few months. But then I got back to like, No, wait, if you want to get something done, like I can launch a Wix website in a day like I got back to the kind of just move really fast and get stuff done, being able to make progress on a lot of fronts in a very short period of time.","The speaker reflects on transitioning from running a large company to being an entrepreneur again, emphasizing the ability to quickly accomplish tasks and make progress on multiple fronts."
Every CEO and Founder needs to understand this!  #entrepreneurship #money #business,"One of the things I tell every CEO I work with, if you had a test, the curve is a 22 out of 100. That's the average. If you grade yourself on a 90 out of 100, like, you know, normally getting an A is 90 out of 100. And usually people who choose to be CEOs are people who like A's. You're going to feel like you're failing every day, which you kind of are. But once you baseline that as the role, then it's like, oh, OK, this is a lot easier.","CEOs should expect to feel like they are failing every day, as the average performance in their role is only 22 out of 100."
"Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube are spying on you？  #socialmedia #cookies #developer","Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok are not listening to you. What they're actually doing is much more effective. What's actually happening is let's say that you and I go get lunch together. Well, we both bring our devices with us, and we have a browsing history on both of our devices. I might have looked at couches, you might have looked at mortgages, and we sit down for an hour. Now, Facebook technically knows that our two phones were next to each other for a period of time. So since they know that they can guess that we probably talked about a lot of topic, maybe we talked about mortgages, maybe we talked about mattresses. So they'll actually show us each other's browsing history via ads, guessing that we probably talked about one of those things with each other. Now, this is where our brain comes into play. There's a cognitive bias known as the Bader-Manoff phenomenon. You know, when you buy a new pair of shoes, all of a sudden start noticing those shoes or that car everywhere? That's actually a brain cognitive bias that makes you pay attention to something because you now have it. Well, once you've been to a website or you had a copy conversation with your friend, you're much more likely to notice the mattress ad or the mortgage ad because it came up in your conversation.","Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok use browsing history and proximity data to show users ads based on their conversations, leveraging the Bader-Manoff phenomenon to increase attention and engagement."
Firing people is hard but necessary #entrepreneurship #money #business,"Netflix did that great thing of we're a team, not a family. If you're going to tell people you're a family, you got to behave like family. Family doesn't fire people. They find other things for them to do. And there are companies, by the way, that operate like there's nothing wrong with that. But if you're going to run your business, you have investors. If you're trying to hit ambitious targets, you know, you can be an optimist, but you also have to explain we're a team and baseball players love each other. They'll win a team and then the next day they'll get traded. And it works because everybody kind of understands what they're signing up for.","Netflix operates as a team, not a family, and believes in finding new roles for employees instead of firing them. This approach aligns with their ambitious targets and investor expectations."
"Generative AI applications are dominating the markets, the next opportunity for investors","Investors are plowing capital into generative AI right now. Jasper AI just raised $125 million at a $1.5 billion valuation. It's only two years old, by the way, the company's only two years old. I thought of AI as a how, we're going to use it in each of the businesses, but not necessarily build a business around it. So I think at minimum, if you're a services business, whatever you are, use AI at the core. I think it's going to become a critical part of any kind of business building. 30 years ago, businesses didn't rely on engineering at all. And now it's just core to every business. I think the same thing will happen with AI generally. And so getting smart on it's super important.","Jasper AI raises $125 million in funding, highlighting the growing interest in generative AI. AI is becoming essential for businesses and will likely follow the same trajectory as engineering did 30 years ago."
How does AI works？ #gpt3 #openai #chatgpt,"The reality of all AI, just so everybody knows, is all it's doing is it just looks at lots of data and uses a bunch of historical things that have happened, like which word follows which word in a sentence, and then predicts that that's likely to be the word. And I think that's everyone, by the way, deals with AI every day, which is when you're texting, the auto suggest is essentially an AI. It's basically saying, based on the sentence you're writing, here's what I think is going to be the next word that you should put. And then, of course, they give you a few options. And then, by the way, on average, which option you pick, they then learn, and the learning gets better and smarter.","AI uses historical data to predict the next word in a sentence, as seen in auto-suggest features. It learns and improves based on user choices."
How I Discovered GrowthAssistant and How It Revolutionized Workflows,"My first job was in consulting and, you know, I was sitting there making slides one day and my manager looks across and he goes, Hey, you don't need to be doing that. You can just write them on a page and send them to India overnight and you'll wake up the next morning and the slides will be done for you. And I was 22 or 23 and I was like, Oh, this is amazing. And so when we started Ampush, one of the first things I did was I said, we're going to build an offshore team that's going to handle a lot of the manual work associated with running ads. And that team is now 50 plus people. And, and, you know, we'd have people who'd work at Ampush for a few years and leave to go do growth at a brand. And they would call me and go, man, I need that team. And I said, well, yeah, isn't there, there's nobody who you can offshore that too. They go, that doesn't exist. And so we started this business called growth assistant and it's, it's grown. I mean, we have over 200 people in the Philippines already and over a hundred customers. A hundred customers already? In like 18, less than 18 months. And I think now I, now I view growth marketing as the next computer science.","Ampush CEO discusses the growth of their offshore team and the success of their business, Growth Assistant, which provides growth marketing services with over 200 employees and 100 customers in less than 18 months."
How I Find Great Entrepreneurs,"How do you find these people to partner with? What criteria do you use or how are you able to judge them effectively? One of my favorite entrepreneurial kind of criteria is we call it like entrepreneurial rigor. There's rigorous, which is you're analytical, you're quantitative, you're thoughtful and reflective. And then there's entrepreneurial, which is like you're bold and resourceful. And we actually think the best people cross over those two.","The speaker looks for partners who possess both analytical and entrepreneurial qualities, as they believe the best people have a combination of both."
How I Made $1000 a Month as a Teenager,make a thousand dollars a month as a teenager doing this. when i was 13 my brother and i saw the snow outside and realized there was a huge opportunity going door to door and asking people to snow shovel their driveways. after the first day of doing it we cleared a few hundred dollars pretty easily. then the light bulb went off in our head. we realized that whether you had a huge driveway or a small driveway you'd probably pay about 20 or 30 dollars for someone to come and snow shovel it. so we had our mom drive us to a neighborhood with a bunch of small driveways and what made us a few hundred dollars earlier we made over a thousand dollars shoveling driveways in the same amount of time.,Two teenagers made over a thousand dollars a month by going door to door and shoveling driveways during the winter.
How I Made Thousands of Dollars as a Teenager,"Here are three ways I made thousands of dollars as a teenager. The first business I started was snow shoveling. My brother and I would go to the neighborhood with the smallest driveways, shovel them up as quickly as we could, charge $20 to $30 each, and made a ton of money doing it. The second business was being a DJ. Weddings, graduations, anyone who needed something, we would have the music ready to go, and we'd do $500 a night to DJ. The third one was in college I started a t-shirt business. We helped fraternities and sororities get their t-shirts printed for date parties and made a boatload of money.","As a teenager, the speaker made thousands of dollars through snow shoveling, DJing, and running a t-shirt business."
How increase profits on your e-commerce website？ Kahani App. #shopify #dropshipping #money,"We're looking at e-commerce websites and they haven't changed in 10 or 15 years. We just think they're boring, they're old. And we asked ourselves the question, who's really good at engaging you on mobile because these websites look just old and tired and the obvious answer was TikTok, Instagram. And so we said, what would happen if you could actually redesign the e-commerce experience to look and feel like TikTok and Instagram, and that's what Kahani is. We give software to e-commerce retailers that make their entire site interactive. So you can swipe, you can tap just like you're on TikTok or Instagram, but you're actually on a website URL.","Kahani is a software that aims to redesign e-commerce websites to be more engaging and interactive, similar to TikTok and Instagram."
How McKinsey Taught Me the Magic of Offshoring,"Here's how I first learned the magic of offshoring. At the age of 22, I worked at McKinsey and Company, and was working on my slides until late in the night. My manager looked over my shoulder and said, hey Jesse, you should send those to India. You can just draw them up on a page, and they'll make those slides for you, and they'll be in your inbox the next day. And so I did it, and the first time I ever did it, it was like magic. That led me to realize the value and power of offshoring. When I started Ampush, my first company, one of the first hires I made was a small team in India who helped me make and create Facebook ads and upload them. Fast forward 10 years, and I realized that was a service that any brand or agency should have, and I started Growth Assistant. Growth Assistant essentially allows any brand or agency to have an awesome offshore marketing team, and they take on the important, but more manual and rote tasks inside the business. We started the business two years ago, and we have over 300 people already in the Philippines working with 100 brands and agencies.","The speaker learned the value of offshoring while working at McKinsey, leading them to start Growth Assistant, a service that provides offshore marketing teams to brands and agencies."
How to Avoid Being a Victim of Change in Your Business,"I think the best organizations, you know, they're reorganizing their companies every nine months, right? I mean, McKinsey is an extreme example, moves everybody around every three months. Like they're all on new projects. And so like the best organizations are constantly moving people around and changing things up because they start to actually be drivers of change, not victims of change.",The best organizations constantly reorganize and move employees around to become drivers of change rather than victims.
How to find motivation？ Identify these 5 frameworks. #motivation #success  #mindset,"There's five types of motivators. There's fear, there's extrinsic, there's intrinsic, there's play genius, and then there's like empathic love, right? And fear is could be anything from I don't think I'm much highly of myself. So I have to prove that I'm a certain way. In my case, it was I don't think I'll be successful. Like I wanted to be successful so badly. And I didn't think I would be. And so I would just use that gap to constantly motivate myself. Fear is very effective, right? You put a gun to my head, I'll run faster than I've ever run. But then as soon as the guns gone, I stopped running.","The transcript discusses five types of motivators: fear, extrinsic, intrinsic, play genius, and empathic love. Fear is effective but temporary."
How to find your purpose in life？ Most people don't get it. #business #lifehacks #business #mindset,"We make finding purpose a threatening experience. Because we say, what is my purpose? Oh, I need a purpose. I must have a purpose. Why don't I have a purpose? Whatever your purpose is, it's actually a form of being. It's just being who you are. And so, like, your purpose is not a thing you go get. It's already with you. The second part of it was, by the way, you probably demonstrate your purpose on a regular basis. You just haven't kind of put your finger on it just yet. What's the one thing you can't not do?","The purpose is not something to be found or obtained, but rather a form of being. It is already within you and is demonstrated regularly in your actions."
How to Have an Infinite Runway for Your Business,"How do you think about building businesses? I've always kind of been obsessed with bootstrapping and kind of starting and generating a profit. And the reason was there's something that never quite sat well with me about I take money and I'm burning it and I have like an end date. Like I have this thing called a runway that I will eventually drive off of. And one thing I've often said to people at any stage of their company, just get to one dollar a month in profit, because if you're in one dollar a month in profit, your runway becomes infinite.",The speaker emphasizes the importance of bootstrapping and generating profit to avoid burning through funding and having a limited runway.

The second one is I think there's a certain stock picking things I'll do where I believe the business itself can compound over a very long time. And 10 years ago for me, that was Google, Facebook, Amazon, MasterCard, Visa. And that just crushed it. The next 10 years, I think it's companies like Twilio, Shopify, a handful of other ones.

How to pick the right business idea？ #business #entrepreneur #ecommerce  #wealth,"What gets me excited? We have a bunch of ideas. Which one do I keep finding myself research? Or when I talk about it, I light up or I become excited about it. You have to follow that. I think it's important to follow that energy of an excitement. Brainstorm a bunch of a list of different things. Flush them out with some competitive and customer validation research. See which ones you have an unfair advantage in starting and then choose based on your energy and excitement for that idea.","It is important to follow the energy and excitement when choosing an idea to pursue, after brainstorming and validating different options."
"How To Work Smart, Not Hard","How did you decide what you did versus what you like paid other people to do? Yeah, I'm like kind of lazy and not really a doer. Certainly not anymore because I'm old. I'm an old man. But I think that I am actually very good at holding people accountable and sort of like keeping pace with things and ensuring things are getting done in a certain way. But like some of it is like where is my genius going to add value to this? I think that's probably the biggest question I ask.","The speaker discusses their preference for delegating tasks and their ability to hold others accountable, while considering where their expertise can add value."
How We Got The Idea for a 7 Figure Business,"You guys have narrowed down around marketing and you've narrowed down around the Philippines. And like, was this where you started or did you start with something else? No, it's been like pretty straightforward from the get go. I mean, and really it started at Ampush. You know, my first company, we had built our own offshore team and we'd have all these folks who would spend two or three years at Ampush, then go work in house at a brand and they'd call me and go, can I use that, that, that team? And we'd say, well, no, you'd have to be a client of Ampush to have access to that. And so as I started building GatewayX, it was like, this idea was at the top of the list, but it's, it's been a model where we embed people in the teams. We're paying attention to their training and making sure that they're top notch. But I think the most unique thing about it has been the training and the embedded model. So it's like somewhere I was described as somewhere between Upwork, which is very project based and one-off and a normal full-time employee, which is expensive. So they're full-time, they're embedded, they're on the team, they know the context, but they're able to get a lot of these kinds of tasks and work done that are really, really valuable.","GatewayX offers embedded marketing teams in the Philippines, providing training and valuable work at a lower cost than full-time employees."
I started Ampush when i was 25 and bootstrap it to 30m in revenue. #business #entrepreneur #money,"I started Ampush when I was 25. We grew the business super hard, super aggressive, bootstrapped it to 30 million in revenue in four or five years and killed ourselves doing it. I mean, it was rough. I killed other people too, all the while having great good intentions, let's say. Do you think there are people that still dislike you from Ampush? I'm sure. When I look back on it, I go, oh yeah, okay, I see. I see how I created that. We sold a big chunk of the company, had the success check mark, quote unquote. I had this period after my daughter was born where I just didn't want to go to work for probably six months. Jesse, you're the luckiest MF-er in the world. There's some inner work to be done.","The founder of Ampush reflects on the aggressive growth of the company, acknowledging the negative impact it had on others and expressing a desire for personal growth."
Is Work-Life Balance Possible in Management Consulting？,"When I did management consulting, I would not describe what I had as a work-life balance. I was 22, you know, you're traveling four days a week. The good weeks were 60 hours, the bad weeks were 80 or 90. I learned a ton, which was really fun and got to work with a lot of great people. But yeah, I don't think, you know, at that age I wasn't... I also wasn't really looking for work-life balance. If anything, my roommates were doing investment banking and they were like, dang, you have an easy life, man. You're just chilling relative to what they were putting in.","The speaker reflects on their experience in management consulting, describing long work hours and a lack of work-life balance."
"Mark Zuckerberg first interview, how we try to make Facebook for High Schools back in 2006 #tech","How did you call Mark Zuckerberg? Explain that story. 2005, he was some junior at Harvard. Facebook was in 10 colleges or 20 colleges. We were very entrepreneurial and we were like, let's start a high school version of Facebook. Well, we're like, what should we call it? Let's call it HS Facebook. And so we find who owns hsfacebook.com. And it was some other kid who was the same age as us at Columbia. He was like, I want 20 grand for it. We're like, we don't have 20 grand. We called the business, the high list.com built the whole thing. We launched it. It actually, we started to see all the same trends of virality. He pings us and goes, Mark Zuckerberg wants to buy HS Facebook. Apparently they're launching in high schools. Tons of fear. Like the next two days we were paralyzed, have to figure out if it's true. Like what if the guy is just BSing us to get us to buy his domain, prove it. And he forwards us an email from him. And it's an email from Mark Zuckerberg with Mark Zuckerberg's cell number.","In 2005, the speaker and his team created a high school version of Facebook called HS Facebook. They were approached by Mark Zuckerberg who wanted to buy it."
Meeting with your tax advisors on a monthly basis #entrepreneur #business #taxes #income,"I meet with my tax advisors every other week, throughout the year. Every other week? If there was some part of your business, Alex, that's worth 20 to 40% of what you're going to ultimately achieve, wouldn't you manage it at least every other week? I mean, everything else, every other part of it, the advertising sales, the this, the that, you manage daily or weekly. And somebody said that to me once. I wasn't doing that, and I was like, oh yeah, you're right. And so I'll tell them what's going on in the business, I'll give them an update on this.","The speaker meets with tax advisors every other week, realizing the importance of managing this aspect of their business regularly."
"Motivation？ Have unrealistic goals, exceed your dreams #business #entrepreneurship #motivation","If I don't have a big target, I need to hit, how am I going to get out of bed in the morning because I need this fear. And, and at one point he said to me, he goes, Jesse, what are you afraid of? Is it going to happen? If you don't give yourself some huge market cap or revenue number to go hit. And I go, I don't know. What if I like watch Netflix all day and I just don't do shit. And he goes, do it. He goes, go, I want you to take a week off work. I did it, you know, after three days, I was like, this is boring. I want to go do some interesting stuff. He goes, what you see is that you're still a creative guy who wants to go build stuff. You don't have to use fear as the thing to get you to do that.","The transcript discusses the importance of having a big target or fear to motivate oneself, but also highlights the possibility of finding motivation through personal interests and creativity."
Mr Beast is raising $150 million at a 1.5b valuation #youtube #wealth #business #socialmedia,"Axios reported a few days ago that Mr. Beast is raising $150 million for his business, $1.5 billion valuation, and this is across his whole business. I don't think about Disney and Jimmy all that differently. I think the Disney analogy is very apt. Do you know what year Snow White was made in? I'm going to guess 1940. 1947. 1937. My daughter can name all the dwarves, so can most people. Media has a crazy, I mean, it's the original software business. I probably wouldn't invest because it's not my profile of an investment, but if I was a private equity guy, I would definitely invest. Like, if I was using a fund and had that kind of return profile, I would definitely invest.","Mr. Beast is raising $150 million for his business, with a $1.5 billion valuation. The Disney analogy is fitting, as media is a lucrative industry."
My Biggest Lesson From Working at McKinsey and Goldman Sachs,"My biggest lesson working at McKinsey and Goldman Sachs was to maintain a really high bar for hiring. Both companies are notorious for long interview processes, quantitative questions, psychological questions, and what I realized being a part of that experience and then watching what it did is once you had really bright people on the other side of that filter, you could get anything done fast and effectively. It's something I've brought with me in all my entrepreneurial ventures since then.","Maintaining a high hiring standard is crucial for success, as observed by the speaker's experience at McKinsey and Goldman Sachs, where talented individuals led to efficient and effective outcomes."
My Biggest Unfair Advantage as an Entrepreneur,"Here's one of my biggest unfair advantages, having immigrant parents, especially immigrant entrepreneur parents. When I grew up, my dad was 24. He had two young children. And from the time I could remember, he was an entrepreneur. One thing I remember very distinctly was he never talked about having an employer, he never talked about having a boss, his mindset was to be the owner to run the business. And that left a huge imprint on me, even as I was working at fancy jobs at McKinsey and Goldman Sachs, I still knew I wasn't owning the business and running it. And so having that mentality brought in in a really early time really shaped me in unique ways.","Growing up with immigrant entrepreneur parents gave the speaker a unique advantage, as their mindset of being the owner and running a business left a lasting impact on them."
My Vision for Gateway X,"The desired future state for GatewayX and my dream is a bunch of companies operating under one sort of common culture and common way of doing things. Really focused on launching new ventures when we have the good ideas and we have the right people. And we're teaching and coaching people on how to be the best versions of themselves. Uh, and, and we're, we're growing and scaling the business. So rather than joining McKinsey or Goldman Sachs out of college, you joined GatewayX where you're going to learn how to run a business. We're going to scale you and teach you a bunch of different things. And eventually you'll start your own business under our umbrella.","GatewayX aims to create a unified culture and approach, focusing on launching ventures, coaching individuals, and scaling the business. It offers an alternative path for individuals to learn how to run a business and eventually start their own."
Overcoming Perfectionism and Taking Action to Start Your TikTok Marketing,"What advice would you give to someone in your shoes just getting started in marketing to potentially approach a platform like TikTok? The biggest, best piece of advice I can give someone similar to Twitter is just do it. Get engaged into it. Stop worrying about whether you're doing it right. Stop asking people for, you know, the perfect advice. Not to say you shouldn't ask for advice, you can definitely ask people, but a lot of people use that as a way to just not try it and do it. And like start making TikToks, start posting things onto the page, and really get to know and get to understand the platform.","The advice for someone starting in marketing on TikTok is to just do it, stop worrying about doing it right, and start making TikToks to understand the platform."
Performance marketing was our tool to make money quickly #business #entrepreneurship #money,"We wanted something that would make us money quickly. We'd also learn from it. And so someone said, go look at digital marketing. And there's this type of marketing called performance marketing. They'll just pay you for every successful customer you drive for them. Okay. Cost you $25 on Google to buy the AdWords and then you can sell it for 50. You make 25, you know, it was super naive. We said, Oh, that sounds great. We can figure that out. And then of course, reality, you know, met us where we said, Oh my God, we don't know how to run an AdWords campaign. We don't know how to set up a website. And eventually we, I think we really just copied like a competitor's landing page and a competitor's keywords. And it started to make a small margin, like a five or 10% margin.",The speaker initially saw potential in performance marketing but quickly realized they lacked the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed.
Scary Times Bring Opportunities： Learn from 2008,"I joined Goldman Sachs three months before Lehman filed for bankruptcy. It was one of the scariest times to be a working professional on Wall Street, in tech, or anywhere else. But something happened the year before that was even more important, and that was the iPhone launching. As we know, because of the iPhone launching, businesses like Uber, Zynga, and many many others launched on the back of that technology. Today, we have another scary situation. There's high inflation, and it feels like we're slowing down. And I believe that AI and some of the AI tools we're seeing are going to be the next version of the iPhone. Are you building against them?",The transcript discusses the impact of the iPhone launch on businesses and predicts that AI tools will be the next game-changing technology.
Should you focus on 1 business or try multiple ideas？ This is what I do. #business #entrepreneur,"All my friends are like, well, why don't you focus on one and make that one? And I have to tell my friends, my goal is not profit expected value maximization. My goal is like enjoyment and purpose. And I said, so in that sense, yes, you're right. I'm probably leaving 20% on the table here, but I'm having much more fun every day. I think your friends are wrong for me, at least.","The speaker's friends question why they don't focus on one thing for profit, but the speaker values enjoyment and purpose over maximizing profit."
Stop Asking for Permission,"People don't want to get in trouble, like they don't want to do something wrong. They don't want to make a mistake. But it's you realize actually how much organizational inertia and slowness sets in because of that one issue, which is like, I'm going to wait for permission and not ask for forgiveness. And I've been kind of going around and kind of going like, hey, stop asking for permission.",The speaker highlights the negative impact of seeking permission and encourages people to stop asking for it to avoid organizational inertia and slowness.
Strategic Planning v1,"Jesse, how do you go about planning for your businesses? The way I think about it, everything starts with what we call a desired future state and desired future state is this future vision that you think is what you want. Where do I want to be? And the point of the DFS is forcibly disconnect people from reality. We actually want that. We want people to have an open and big vision. The more vivid you can make that future vision, the better. Here's what I hope the revenue and EBITDA look like. Here's what I think my headcount will look like. Here's the offerings I want to have. Here's what my product will do. So that's how we start. And then we flip the script and we go, OK, now let's acknowledge current reality. Where are we right in this moment? What is our revenue? What is our headcount? What is what are we offering? Then a lot of the strategic planning is, OK, cool. Well, how do I get from here to there?","The transcript discusses the process of planning for businesses, starting with envisioning a desired future state and then acknowledging the current reality to strategize the path to achieve the desired state."

And that's gonna like, you remind me of the 22 year old version of the entrepreneur is like, then once my Kickstarter works, then I'll be in business, Jesse. And I'm like, dude, this is in business. Just commit to it.",The speaker is encouraging someone to commit to their business idea instead of waiting for a Kickstarter campaign to be successful.
The 5 Types of Motivators And How To Turn Fear into Love,"There's five types of motivators. There's fear, there's extrinsic money titles, there's intrinsic, like beating your own score. There's play genius. And then there's like love, the empathic love. It's like the love of the human experience, helping the human experience. And we all use all of them all the time, but we tend to default to a few of them. And especially entrepreneurs, we love fear. We just, we're, we're addicted to it. The downsides of fear are that they leave a negative residue on you and others. They use Bill Gates as this example. He was the fear driven guy. Then he became the richest man in the world. It was like, I'm bored. And then he jumped all the way to empathic love. I'm going to go cure polio. That's what's next for me. And that's what has sustained him actually longer than Microsoft sustained him. So the other downside of fear is it's not sustainable.","The transcript discusses five types of motivators: fear, extrinsic rewards, intrinsic satisfaction, play genius, and empathic love. It highlights the downsides of fear and how Bill Gates transitioned from fear to empathic love for sustained motivation."
The Creator Economy： Predictions for the Future,"Do you have any predictions for the year? I think one of the big things is there will be a shakeout in the creator economy. I think that category of people and workers is going to continue to grow and explode. I think similar to all the rest of the economy, it's been overbuilt for what the demand is going to be now. It's going to pull back. There's going to be a flight to quality. But in the medium run, let's say two to three years, it's going to keep being a critical workforce. And I think there's a huge opportunity. One of our list of ideas and items is creating services for that category.","The creator economy will experience a shakeout, but will continue to grow in the long run. There is a huge opportunity in creating services for this workforce."
The Entrepreneurial Journey： Building a Legacy that Outlasts You,I think a lot of people who think about starting a company don't get this until you do it. One of the coolest parts of the entrepreneurial journey is building something that is beyond you and outlasts you.,Starting a company is a rewarding experience as it involves building something that goes beyond oneself and lasts for a long time.
The Evolution of a Startup and The Power of Building a Lasting Legacy in Entrepreneurship,"You know, I always call it the gravitational force of company building. And it's just it's not something I realize. And I think a lot of people who think about starting a company don't get this until you do it. You know, it starts as a speckle of dust and then five speckles of dust. And the next thing you know, it's a few rocks. And like, I remember the first time I saw someone out in public where I had an Ampush T-shirt on and they were like, oh, yeah, Ampush. Like it was a thing that wasn't me. And it was separate. And I see those T-shirts on on Etsy. I think it's a reminder of like the one of the coolest parts of the entrepreneurial journey is building something that like is beyond you and outlasts you. And I just encourage people to think about it that way because it's so powerful.",The transcript discusses the satisfaction of building a company that becomes separate from oneself and outlasts the founder.
The Evolution of E-Commerce： How Kahani is Changing the Game,"E-commerce websites haven't changed in 10 years. They look and feel like they belong on a desktop. And the big vision is like, we're going to have a bunch of mobile features and functionality that are going to make mobile sites more engaging and easy to use. And, and you just think about how little like tapping, swiping, all these things that are normal in other parts of your phone, you don't do on an e-commerce website. The first one we shipped is, you know, essentially the stories experience from Instagram, but brought on to like an e-commerce experience. So it's got the, you know, it's got those little circles at the top. You tap on them and next thing you know, you're looking at products on a website and you can swipe through them quickly and tap through them. And then we've seen it pretty dramatically improve average order value for, for multifashion sites.",A new e-commerce website aims to make mobile shopping more engaging and easy to use by incorporating features similar to Instagram stories. This has resulted in a significant increase in average order value for fashion sites.
The Formula for Overcoming Challenges in Entrepreneurship,Thanks for watching!,The transcript is too short to generate a meaningful summary.
The Future of Social Media is Here,"Is there anything that's ongoing right now that feels to have that severity of like, oh shit, everything's about to change? We were betting on a couple of things we're building internally on TikTok. And not that I can tell you we've done anything that interesting yet on it. We haven't seen it, but I'm looking at it. I'm looking at the scale, looking at how it works. And I'm going, man, this seems like an interesting place to be betting right now. We're not going to do anything on Facebook, Instagram, nothing. We're going to force ourselves to launch this brand on TikTok. We think there's a unique opportunity there.","The speaker is considering TikTok as a platform to launch their brand, believing it offers a unique opportunity compared to Facebook and Instagram."
The Importance of Talent and Partnership in Accomplishing Multiple Goals,"I think the Vendor Studio model sounds like a great idea if you're working on like different projects at the same time. How are you able to juggle that effectively? I think the most important thing far and away is talent and partnership. You've got to find great people and partner well with them. It's almost from the first minute you can't do it alone. And so, you know, each of the businesses, they'll have a person who's running the day to day and they've got great people, great at partnering, great at delegating and being really clear about what you will and won't do.",The Vendor Studio model requires effective talent and partnership to juggle multiple projects. Clear delegation and partnering are key.
The new generation of social media applications like BeReal #business #entrepreneurship #technology,"The other thing that's cool just as a trend, I think, is this sort of second or third generation of social apps, right? There was Facebook, obviously, and Twitter and LinkedIn. It's like, oh, people are mean on those things. And they do have the tendency because they drive only for engagement. And it's totally open to sometimes be the worst of humanity. You know, the second one on that list was Be Real. It's all about you have to take a picture of what you're actually doing in that moment. So you can't get all fancy and all dolled up. And then this one is coming out with saying positive things about other people. Like, I think that's also a cool trend we're seeing. You can shift people's brains. If we can use the power of dopamine to be super positive all the time or drive more of that direction, I think it's pretty cool.","The transcript discusses the trend of second or third generation social apps that aim to promote positivity and authenticity, shifting people's mindset towards being more positive."
The Power of Starting Small and How It Can Lead to Big Opportunities in Entrepreneurship,"Entrepreneurs have careers also. I think people miss that. Getting an exit under your belt at a young age, it opens up doors. It opens up doors that otherwise wouldn't be open, even if your company was bigger. And even Elon Musk, his first company was like a little ad tech business that put ads in newspaper websites that he sold. People work their way up to these massive insane bets. Very few people just end up and start there. It's okay to have a small win. Start a consulting business, sell it for five or ten grand. That's a huge outcome and it will set you up for the next thing and you can keep swinging bigger each time.","Having a small win as an entrepreneur can open up doors for future success, as demonstrated by Elon Musk's first company being a small ad tech business."
The Pros and Cons of Venture Studios,"What are the pros and cons of Venture Studios? So, you know, it depends on who's asking the question. I think from my perspective, the pros are, it's a lot of fun. I get to play around with lots of different ideas. I get to work and coach different leaders and we have lots of different opportunities. We have a lot of at-bats. The cons of course, are always the biggest challenge with any entrepreneurial or business venture, which is focus. Now, inside of the studio, nobody works on multiple things except for me. And so we try to maintain focus in that way. I think the other big thing is sometimes when you have a good idea that's taking off, you kind of want to put all your resources, time and money into that. And oftentimes people will start Venture Studios and then they'll end up holding it all into one venture because it takes off. So there's always that issue of kind of allocating capital and allocating time appropriately. What's unique about GatewayX that's different than a lot of the other Venture Studios is I'm actually trying to build businesses that I'm then turning into more of like a holding company structure. So the idea is spin it up. Ideally it starts generating cashflow and then we can own it and scale it for a really long time.","Venture Studios offer opportunities for experimentation and coaching, but maintaining focus and allocating resources can be challenging. GatewayX aims to build businesses and turn them into a holding company structure for long-term scalability."
The Secret to Building a Strong Team and Shaping Your Company's Culture,"What do you think consulting taught you that helped you become a better entrepreneur? Biggest one I'd say is just the high bar and rigor for talent. If there was anything we did that was smart about getting Amplish off the ground was we saw and learned how these top firms recruited and the level and the types of interviews. And we said, okay, we're going to do that when we look for people. And I think that just helped us get an amazing amount of talent. And once you have 10 really awesome people, like they go find another 10 awesome people. And the next thing you know, the whole company has a really high bar for culture and talent.","Consulting taught the speaker the importance of hiring top talent, which helped them build a company with a high bar for culture and talent."
The Secret to Solving Problems That Transformed My Career,"My biggest lesson working for McKinsey & Company was structured problem solving. Every time there's an issue or business problem, there's multiple variables affecting that problem. McKinsey actually teaches a course in something called Issue Trees, where you take a business problem like revenues down or marketing expenses are up and you break it down into all the component drivers that then allow you to figure out what's actually changing and what do you do to solve it. This skill is something that I got very early on in my career at the age of 22 and I've used it every day as an entrepreneur.","The speaker learned structured problem solving at McKinsey & Company, which involved breaking down business problems into component drivers to find solutions. This skill has been valuable in their career as an entrepreneur."
This App is Going to Change E-Commerce,"The vision for Kahani is really to build a set of software tools that allow merchants to make their shopping experience on mobile, much more mobile native, you can have the stories functionality, we're going to ship a bunch of new things where you can have video really easily integrated. But the idea is the e-com website hasn't changed in 15 years, and we're going to give all the tools to the merchants to make them, it's going to look just like TikTok and Instagram in the future. That's what the e-com experience will look like.","Kahani aims to provide software tools for merchants to enhance the mobile shopping experience, incorporating features like stories and easy video integration, similar to TikTok and Instagram."
This is how I manage my time #entrepreneurship #timemanagement #businesscoach #skilldevelopment,"My biggest time management hack for anybody and for myself is like, I am really anal about prioritizing. And so the way I manage my time really is like on a Sunday, I will think about the one thing literally for each of the businesses that I want to get done that week that I think is super important. And I'll just really focus in on that and make sure that my time is being allocated to that thing.",The speaker's time management hack is to prioritize tasks by choosing one important thing for each business and focusing on it for the week.
This is how to grow on twitter #skillset #digitalmarketingtips #businessidea #twitterthreads,"A lot of friends of mine, Oh my God, how'd you do that, Jesse? And then they'll start writing threads and it doesn't work. I think you really have to first become a lover of the like reading and the engaging of Twitter before you start producing content. I think a couple of years ago or before I was like randomly posting content, no engagement. I just, I started learning from it and reading it and it's almost like I became a real user of it. I was getting a ton of value out of it. So I tell people, I go first, make sure you're going to get a lot of value as a reader and whatever, then start to see if you can join the party and add value to it.","Before producing content on Twitter, it is important to become an engaged reader and learn from the platform. Adding value comes after gaining value as a reader."
Unlock Your Financial Freedom： Personal Finance Masterclass,"Hi everyone, I'm excited to share how this simple Excel sheet has transformed my finances. So today I want to go over my finance tracking worksheet where I have a template created which basically tracks finances every month. So at the beginning of each month, I input all my finance sources like my salary, side hustle and other earnings. I also track my savings and investment separately along with any debts I may have to pay. Now the magic happens when I plug in all the numbers. Voila, the sheet automatically generates all the numbers which makes it incredibly powerful for gaining insights into my finances. Now let's see. Let me walk you through some of the insights which I have gained using the Excel sheet. So basically as we can see, this is a sample data which I have created. So in the first column, I have all the sources where my money is there and in the first row, it is like every month I'm going to track it and to see how it grows from one month to another. If I can form any strategies to improve how it should grow from one month to another will also be made here. So basically some of the key insights which this will help in drawing is four things. That is expense breakdown, saving rate, debt reduction, progress and investment growth. So discussing about expense breakdown, this shows me exactly how my money is changing each month. It helps me identify area where I may be overspending, allowing me to make necessary adjustment and save more. Second is saving rate. This helped me track my saving rate over time. Seeing my progress encourages me to save more aggressively and reach my financial goals faster. Third is debt reduction progress. So the Excel sheet visually shows my debt payments and their impact on my overall financial health. This motivates me to pay off the debt faster and reduce any such interest payments or expenses. Fourth is investment growth. That is tracking my investment through this allows me to evaluate their performance and make informed decision about my portfolio. So basically these insights have been eye-opening for me. For instance, I realized I was spending a lot of non-essential items, lot on the non-essential items. So I made a conscious effort to cut back on those expenses and allocate more to saving and investment. So updating this Excel sheet is simple and quick. I do it once a month to stay on top of my finances and make real-time adjustments if needed to my strategies to grow the balance in the accounts. So before I dive into more details and go over the numbers which you see in the Excel sheet, I want to mention one key thing is to be consistent. That is remember always consistency is the key to financial success and if we are doing this exercise regularly every month over a span of multiple months, we can able to see the insights through this data and make deliberate effort to increase it month over month. So now I want to give you some advice if you are thinking about trying this method yourself. So start today. Don't wait start tracking your finances in a right way even with a basic Excel sheet. Second is which I've already mentioned you about is stay consistent and third is act upon your insights. If you find anything like any amount which can be invested, try to go find out different sources on the YouTube or via blog post and see how can that be improved and take the cautious step towards it just as we say walk the talk and like taking cautious actions towards making it happen. So yeah going over this Excel sheet is over here I have all the bank accounts, credit cards, all the brokerage accounts and as we can see in column C, I have number associated column C, D, E and F. I have number associated with all these account like the account balance. So basically when we plug in all the numbers from 2 to 20, this number what we see over here in the total automatically gets calculated. So it's just a matter of plugging in the numbers. Now as we can see in this example, at the end of April, we have an account balance of $31 same at the month of May we have $33, in month of June we have $107 and in month of July we have $153. So based on this we can see that every month the account balance is growing. So that is a good thing. Now we have to find out, we have to basically answer few questions over here, first is by how much is the account balance growing each month as compared to the previous month. So line number 23, this is a row which tells that, so in month of May as compared to April, it has increased by $2 like the saving each month or the amount which we get each month. Same thing in June, it has increased $74 as compared to May and similarly in July it has increased $46 as compared to June. So that is one thing, this will definitely help us, this will provide us insight to see how the amount is growing every month. And if the amount is growing less then we can find, we can definitely ask ourself question why, what can we do, what things can be changed to make it grow more. So the total also definitely helps as it will mention like at the end of each month, including all the things which are your assets and which are your liabilities, this is the amount which is either being in your bank at the end of the day or being spent. So this is something which is very crucial as well to see how the total compensation, what is your net worth, how it is changing over time. So that is definitely a really good insight, apart from that, in the comments as we can see over here, there are some of the brokerage accounts where I have mentioned like for Robinhood and for Webull, the amount which is invested and which is not invested, which is just sitting around there. So the action plan at least for me was to first to identify that and the second thing which I thought of doing is to go out there, find out sources to see how can that amount be invested. So basically we are looking for those kind of gaps, we have to find out the amount which can be invested, which is just sitting around there, not giving us any profit and to see how can that work for us. How can that earn itself like either via dividends or via interest, any sorts of thing. So that will definitely help in growing your finances in a very data driven manner. So in conclusion, this excel sheet has been a game changer for me and I hope it will be for you too. So take charge for your financial future and watch your money grow. I wish all of you all the best.","Using a simple Excel sheet to track finances has transformed the speaker's financial situation. The sheet automatically generates insights on expense breakdown, saving rate, debt reduction progress, and investment growth. Consistency and acting upon insights are key."

We acquired a company for 0$ and sold it for millions the next year #business #entrepreneur #money,"Could you imagine someone giving you a company for free and the next year selling it for millions? That actually happened to me. The year was 2012. I was starting my first business called Ampush. We had found a publisher by the name of AcademicEarth.org. We were trying to generate student interest and leads for online universities, and we contacted AcademicEarth, and they became one of our biggest partners. AcademicEarth was started by someone named Richard Ludlow, and Bill Gates actually called the website his favorite website of all time, and he got into Harvard Business School. And he called us one day and he said, Hey, guys, I'm going to Harvard. I'm not going to run my startup anymore. He's like, Do you want to buy it? And we were like, Well, we have no money. 90 days later, he called us. He said, I can't find a buyer. Do you guys want to buy it? And we said, Well, we'll buy it for no money. And if we can turn it into something, maybe we can share the upside. What do you think? And he said, That's fine with me. And ultimately, we agreed to a deal where we bought AcademicEarth. We took 70% of the company. They retained 30% of the company. And within a year, we sold it for millions of dollars.","In 2012, the founders of Ampush acquired AcademicEarth.org for free and sold it for millions within a year."
What I Want,"I want to wake up every day and do something that I love. And I realized I love entrepreneurship and I love helping other people learn and grow, and I wanted to build a business that would let me do those two things every day and gateway X is like kind of my spin on a venture studio. The idea is let's build businesses where we think there's obviously an unserved need, a product that we can deliver to a market. Any business we start has to leverage one of my unfair advantages. So if it's, it's a consumer business, does it have a big angle on customer acquisition, Facebook ads, and if it's a B2B business, it sells things to brands and marketers, which are obviously the people I know really well. I know their problems. I know how to reach them and get in front of them. And so we've launched three businesses in the last year.","Gateway X is a venture studio that builds businesses to serve unserved needs, leveraging the founder's unfair advantages in customer acquisition and knowledge of brands and marketers."
What is a Venture Studio？,"What is a venture studio? It's really a business that makes other businesses. Think of it like a movie studio. You have a group of people, you come up with new movie ideas, scripts, actors, and you put them out and you create hopefully lots of hits. That's what we do with new ventures. So we will come up with ideas, we start to run some different experiments and tests to see if we think they can work and if they're viable, and then if they are we'll find a CEO and other leaders to put around the table to go and launch the business. So that is what a venture studio is.","A venture studio is a business that generates new business ideas, tests their viability, and then finds leaders to launch and run the businesses."
What is your unfair advantage？  Become extremely good at 1 thing #skills #entrepreneurship,"I've always said like, what's your unfair advantage? First time I wrote that, there's a lot of people being like, Oh, rich uncle. And I was like, no, no, no. What is something, you know, or you have a skill in, or you have some capability or some knowledge, some category, right? If you and I both started a turban e-commerce business, dude, I'd crush you. Right. I know the customers. I know how the product works. I know the issue. I mean, if you really love that product, go start it. Great. But if you just want to start a business, like there's this thing right here that you're telling me, you know how to do, like do that.","The speaker emphasizes the importance of having an unfair advantage in business, suggesting that individuals should focus on their unique skills and knowledge to succeed."
What it Takes to be a Top Entrepreneur： A Lesson from Baseball,"Tell a lot of founders, one of the best baseball players ever just retired for the St. Louis Cardinals, Albert Pujols. I think he's number five overall in the history of baseball. His batting average is 296, which means out of a thousand times, he would get a hit 296. So we talk about, you know, more than 50% hit right now in baseball to be one of the best ever. You have to have 30% of the time successes. And I think in entrepreneurship, it might be even lower, you know, like if you get a couple things really right. So you, you can make a lot of mistakes. And, and I think it's important to embrace that and get really comfortable and actually enjoy making the mistakes.","Albert Pujols, one of the best baseball players, has retired. His batting average of 296 is considered impressive. Mistakes are important in entrepreneurship."
What kind of businesses should be raising money？ #investing #funding,"Curious of what kinds of businesses should be raising money and what kinds of businesses shouldn't? There's two questions. There's a question personally, which is the most important one, I think, and then there's a question about the business. And the sub questions personally are, what do you want your life to be like in 5 or 10 years? Do you want to be the king and own it and run it and make the calls? Or do you want to kind of have something potentially bigger and more meaningful, but like have a board and have this kind of structure where you're essentially working for the company? I think that there's like a big difference there personally. I think also personally, it's like, how much money do you need? And how much do you have? And how much can you in either case, let's say you don't have very much money. Well, that's either a reason to start a very cash flow oriented business or a reason to raise money.",The transcript discusses the importance of personal goals and financial needs when deciding whether to raise money for a business.
What to Do When Feeling Overwhelmed,"Is there anything you do to try to recenter yourself? Yeah, I try to go to gratitude. That's probably like the thing I've been doing the last couple days is just like being in gratitude. I mean, there's always there's the behaviors of like heroing oneself, which is like, Oh, it's fine, suck it up and deal with it. There's the thing of like, Oh, I don't want to feel like this and like fighting that. So I was like, No, this is where this is where we are right now. That's okay. But I try I try to have gratitude and then and then if it gets too intense, like I make changes.","The speaker tries to recenter themselves by practicing gratitude and accepting their current state, but also makes changes if the intensity becomes too much."
When To Give Up On Your Startup,"If you're a new founder starting out, I typically say, like, give yourself two years. Two years is a long time if you're giving it your all every day. So if you don't have anything going interesting within two years, then probably you should do something else.",The transcript advises new founders to give themselves two years to see if their venture is successful before considering other options.
When to start your business？ What side hustle to pick？,"If you start straight out of university without any income, without any savings, to try and start your own business, then you've got to learn all those lessons at the same time as trying to make money. We were glorified by some people that go drop out of university and do it straight away. We had tried side hustles even in college. We were like, oh, we were that kid that was like, we're going to go straight out of college. And I don't think we understood what it really took. And it just never worked for me.",Starting a business straight out of university without savings or income is challenging. Side hustles in college didn't prepare them for the reality.
Why a Repeatable Process Isn't Always Necessary for Launching Businesses,"Do you feel like you've figured out a repeatable process at this point and structure for this venture studio? I don't think I have, and I'm not sure that you should. I do have a high level process that I put together when I was at Ampush with my co-founder there that I call the entrepreneurial loop. It's pretty wide and it's like our version of OKRs almost. So it's like you put together a desired future state. What do you want in the future? Then you put together where you are today and you make sure that the stretch is reasonable, like it's not too much, it's not too little. Then you put together, there's this concept of waypoints, which we really like, which is it's a sailing analogy. I'm not a sailor, but apparently if you were to sail from San Francisco to India, you don't just do it in a straight line. You first go here, then you go here, then you go here. So we spent a lot of time, OK, what's the next most important thing we need to get going? And so it's really kind of gating, you know, whatever you want to call them, like stage gating or like a video game. It's like levels. But we're really big on kind of figuring those out.","The speaker discusses their process for their venture studio, which involves setting a desired future state, assessing the current state, and identifying important milestones along the way."
Why A Venture Studio v1,"What is your journey to like get into doing Adventure Studio? My journey towards it was very much rooted in coaching. It became clear to me that one time my coach asked me, what's the one thing you can't not do? And his theory is it's already something you do. It's so inherent to who you are, but you probably haven't spotted it yet. You know, if you bring it into a room with you, every podcast, every tweet has a piece of it in you. What is that thing, Jesse? And I sort of said it was like to help people raise the bar and like level themselves up. And I use entrepreneurship as a canvas to do it. And you could use sports to be the canvas. Like there's a million ways to get better, to improve yourself. And I happen to use entrepreneurship. That's the one I love. And I was like, so I was like, well, if I wanted to do that in an extreme way, what is the organization that would support that best?",The speaker's journey to Adventure Studio was rooted in coaching and a desire to help people raise the bar and level themselves up through entrepreneurship.
Why Do Consultants Exist？,"Sometimes people ask that question, why do consultants even exist? And the reason is because everyone has a day job at big companies and small companies. Everyone's got a day job, and it's actually helpful to have someone who's not in your day to day come in from the outside, look at what you're doing and help you with something, especially in a world where technology has changed. AI has, okay, now there's this new AI thing, what do I do about it?",Consultants exist to provide outside perspective and help companies navigate new technologies like AI.
Why Luxury Brands are More Successful Than Venture Funded Companies,"What I like about these luxury brands and I think why they're so successful is they're the opposite of venture-funded companies, you know They cannot force growth. By definition if they force growth They will stop being a luxury brand and there's obviously the famous stories about Bernard Assault and LVMH And you know, he realized that early on so he had to like buy other brands because you cannot force You can't go just multiply the number of SKUs in order to grow And so I think what I like about them is I think they build great businesses over a long period of time Because they're they're basically profitable from the beginning and and they take their time to grow and scale","Luxury brands are successful because they prioritize organic growth and profitability, unlike venture-funded companies that force growth through increasing SKUs."
Why My Friends Don't Understand My Business Goals,"All my friends are like, well, why don't you focus on one and make that one, you know, and it's like, I just tell my friends, you know, my business, I'm like, my goal is not profit, you know, expected value maximization, my goal is like life enjoyment. And I said, So in that sense, yes, you're right, I'm probably leaving 20% of the table here. But I'm having much more fun every day. And that's much more important to me.",The speaker prioritizes life enjoyment over profit and acknowledges that they may be leaving potential gains on the table.
Why Raising Money Can Be a Double-Edged Sword for Entrepreneurs,"I always looked at preferred capital in my cap table as debt, because in a downside scenario, that's the first money out, right? That's the way it works. And, you know, I think the right time to raise money, like when people talk about this, one thing I always say to certainly early entrepreneurs, I go, it's your choice. If you want to own 6% or 7% of your business and have, you know, be effectively a high paid employee, because you can, you'll own a lot and you'll have a good salary, you're going to learn from a bunch of VCs or fine people, whatever, they know how to build businesses and grow them. Their goal is you're not aligned, their interests are misaligned. If on the flip side, you want flexibility and you want to run a business for as long as you want, and you don't want, in a downside scenario, you're still going to do all right, because you know, there's not, you don't have to clear any capital.",The speaker discusses the choice between raising money and giving up ownership or maintaining flexibility and running a business independently.
Why St. Louis Beats Out the Big City.,"St. Louis is better than New York City. Here's five reasons why. Reason number one, the real estate is so much cheaper. For $500,000 in St. Louis, you can get a beautiful three-bed, three-bath, 2,500 square feet. In Brooklyn, you could barely get 600 square feet. Reason number two, St. Louis has better food. Emo's pizza, that delicious Provel cheese, the thin crust, better than any New York slice any day of the week. And don't get me started on the bagels. Reason number three, the St. Louis Cardinals are way better than the New York Yankees. We don't buy our way to winning, we have a culture of winning. Reason number four, the people are all nice in St. Louis. You walk by and they look at you and they say good morning and hello.

Why “I Don’t Know” Is a Powerful Phrase for Entrepreneurs,"for a first time entrepreneur, or even a serial entrepreneur, if they feel like they haven't quite figured out product market fit, a lot of people will get panicked about it because they're like, shit, like this whole grand plan I had, what do I do now? And you seem very calm about it. There's some real reasons I have other success and other businesses and push, we have plenty of money in the bank economy. So we have time, which is the most important variable here. But I think the other reason is I did not start this journey saying I know the answer. And I think it's so important for any entrepreneur listening. It's like they call the concept the beginner's mind. When we started going, I was like, I don't know what verticals this is going to work for. I think that's the most important thing is I don't know is a really powerful statement and phrase.

"You don't have a discipline problem, you have an energy problem. Here's how to fix it.","You don't actually have a discipline problem. What you have is an energy problem. Here are four ways to think about managing your energy a little bit better. Number one, work like a lion, not a cow. Most of us have been taught, let's wake up, let's go nine to five, sit at a desk, do the same thing over and over. People who focus on their energy think about when they get the most done and they work during those times, just like a lion waits to go get its prey. Find your zone of genius. There's actually four zones. The zone of incompetence. That's stuff you don't know how to do. The zone of competence, stuff you know how to do, like maybe drive a car. Zone of excellence. For me, that might be spreadsheets. But zone of genius is something that not only am I good at, like the zone of excellence, but also gives me energy. Think yes and not either or.
