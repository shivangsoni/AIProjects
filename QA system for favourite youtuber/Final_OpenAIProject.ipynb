For me, that might be spreadsheets. But zone of genius is something that not only am I good at, like the zone of excellence, but also gives me energy. Think yes and not either or.

So today I want to go over my finance tracking worksheet where I have a template created which basically tracks finances every month. So at the beginning of each month, I input all my finance sources like my salary, side hustle and other earnings. I also track my savings and investment separately along with any debts I may have to pay. Now the magic happens when I plug in all the numbers. Voila, the sheet automatically generates all the numbers which makes it incredibly powerful for gaining insights into my finances. Now let's see. Let me walk you through some of the insights which I have gained using the Excel sheet. So basically as we can see, this is a sample data which I have created. So in the first column, I have all the sources where my money is there and in the first row, it is like every month I'm going to track it and to see how it grows from one month to another. If I can form any strategies to improve how it should grow from one month to another will also be made here. So basically some of the key insights which this will help in drawing is four things. That is expense breakdown, saving rate, debt reduction, progress and investment growth. So discussing about expense breakdown, this shows me exactly how my money is changing each month. It helps me identify area where I may be overspending, allowing me to make necessary adjustment and save more. Second is saving rate. This helped me track my saving rate over time. Seeing my progress encourages me to save more aggressively and reach my financial goals faster. Third is debt reduction progress. So the Excel sheet visually shows my debt payments and their impact on my overall financial health. This motivates me to pay off the debt faster and reduce any such interest payments or expenses. Fourth is investment growth. That is tracking my investment through this allows me to evaluate their performance and make informed decision about my portfolio. So basically these insights have been eye-opening for me. For instance, I realized I was spending a lot of non-essential items, lot on the non-essential items. So I made a conscious effort to cut back on those expenses and allocate more to saving and investment. So updating this Excel sheet is simple and quick. I do it once a month to stay on top of my finances and make real-time adjustments if needed to my strategies to grow the balance in the accounts. So before I dive into more details and go over the numbers which you see in the Excel sheet, I want to mention one key thing is to be consistent. That is remember always consistency is the key to financial success and if we are doing this exercise regularly every month over a span of multiple months, we can able to see the insights through this data and make deliberate effort to increase it month over month. So now I want to give you some advice if you are thinking about trying this method yourself. So start today. Don't wait start tracking your finances in a right way even with a basic Excel sheet. Second is which I've already mentioned you about is stay consistent and third is act upon your insights. If you find anything like any amount which can be invested, try to go find out different sources on the YouTube or via blog post and see how can that be improved and take the cautious step towards it just as we say walk the talk and like taking cautious actions towards making it happen. So yeah going over this Excel sheet is over here I have all the bank accounts, credit cards, all the brokerage accounts and as we can see in column C, I have number associated column C, D, E and F. I have number associated with all these account like the account balance. So basically when we plug in all the numbers from 2 to 20, this number what we see over here in the total automatically gets calculated. So it's just a matter of plugging in the numbers. Now as we can see in this example, at the end of April, we have an account balance of $31 same at the month of May we have $33, in month of June we have $107 and in month of July we have $153. So based on this we can see that every month the account balance is growing. So that is a good thing. Now we have to find out, we have to basically answer few questions over here, first is by how much is the account balance growing each month as compared to the previous month. So line number 23, this is a row which tells that, so in month of May as compared to April, it has increased by $2 like the saving each month or the amount which we get each month. Same thing in June, it has increased $74 as compared to May and similarly in July it has increased $46 as compared to June. So that is one thing, this will definitely help us, this will provide us insight to see how the amount is growing every month. And if the amount is growing less then we can find, we can definitely ask ourself question why, what can we do, what things can be changed to make it grow more. So the total also definitely helps as it will mention like at the end of each month, including all the things which are your assets and which are your liabilities, this is the amount which is either being in your bank at the end of the day or being spent. So this is something which is very crucial as well to see how the total compensation, what is your net worth, how it is changing over time. So that is definitely a really good insight, apart from that, in the comments as we can see over here, there are some of the brokerage accounts where I have mentioned like for Robinhood and for Webull, the amount which is invested and which is not invested, which is just sitting around there. So the action plan at least for me was to first to identify that and the second thing which I thought of doing is to go out there, find out sources to see how can that amount be invested. So basically we are looking for those kind of gaps, we have to find out the amount which can be invested, which is just sitting around there, not giving us any profit and to see how can that work for us. How can that earn itself like either via dividends or via interest, any sorts of thing. So that will definitely help in growing your finances in a very data driven manner. So in conclusion, this excel sheet has been a game changer for me and I hope it will be for you too. So take charge for your financial future and watch your money grow. I wish all of you all the best.\", metadata={'source': 'docs\\\\youtube\\\\Unlock Your Financial Freedom： Personal Finance Masterclass.m4a', 'chunk': 0}), Document(page_content=\"Do you have any predictions for the year?

       "\"Here are three lessons I learned from my immigrant entrepreneur dad. Lesson one, the customer always comes first. One time when I was a kid, I answered the phones at his office and I said, oh, he's busy right now. And he took me in the room and said, you never tell a customer I'm busy. Tell them I'm on the other line and call them back as soon as possible. Lesson number two was hard work can always win and set you apart. I watched my dad travel from meeting to meeting to bring in new business and it left a huge imprint on what it takes to make it successful. And lesson number three is know your numbers. Accounting is the lifeblood of any business. It's the nuts and bolts. And if you don't know your numbers, you don't know your business.\""
